|bedtools|2.11.2 |The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such as finding feature overlaps and computing coverage.|N/A|[Vendor](http://code.google.com/p/bedtools/)|
|biostat|1.0 |Biostatistics local repository|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.sph.umich.edu/biostat/)|
|bowtie|0.12.7 |Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient short read aligner. It aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to the human genome at a rate of over 25 million 35-bp reads per hour. Bowtie indexes the genome with a Burrows-Wheeler index to keep its memory footprint small|N/A|[Vendor](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml)|
|bwa|0.5.9 |Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is an efficient program that aligns relatively short nucleotide sequences against a long reference sequence such as the human genome.|N/A|[Vendor](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)|
|macs|1.3.7.1 |Next generation parallel sequencing technologies made chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) a popular strategy to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions, while creating challenges for analysis algorithms.|N/A|[Vendor](http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/)|
