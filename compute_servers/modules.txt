|bedtools|2.11.2 |The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such as finding feature overlaps and computing coverage.|N/A|[Vendor](http://code.google.com/p/bedtools/)|
|biostat|1.0 |Biostatistics local repository|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.sph.umich.edu/biostat/)|
|bowtie|0.12.7 2.0.6 |Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient short read aligner. It aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to the human genome at a rate of over 25 million 35-bp reads per hour. Bowtie indexes the genome with a Burrows-Wheeler index to keep its memory footprint small|N/A|[Vendor](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml)|
|bowtie2|2.0.6 |Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to keep its memory footprint small|GNU GPLv3|[Vendor](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)|
|bwa|0.5.9 |Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is an efficient program that aligns relatively short nucleotide sequences against a long reference sequence such as the human genome.|N/A|[Vendor](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)|
|cufflinks|2.0.2 |Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.|Boost Software License|[Vendor](http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/)|
|fastqc|0.10.1 |A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data.|GNU GPLv3|[Vendor](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)|
|jags|3.1.0 |JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation  not wholly unlike BUGS.|N/A|[Vendor](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)|
|macs|1.3.7.1 |Next generation parallel sequencing technologies made chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) a popular strategy to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions, while creating challenges for analysis algorithms.|N/A|[Vendor](http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/)|
|mmap|20110912 |mixed models analysis for pedigrees and populations|N/A|[Vendor](http://edn.som.umaryland.edu/mmap/index.php)|
|omegamap|0.5 |omegaMap is a program for detecting natural selection and recombination in DNA or RNA sequences. It is based on a model of population genetics and molecular evolution. The signature of natural selection is detected using the dN/dS ratio (which measures the relative excess of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism) and the signature of recombination is detected from the patterns of linkage disequilibrium.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.danielwilson.me.uk/omegaMap.html)|
|picard|1.84 |Picard comprises Java-based command-line utilities that manipulate SAM files, and a Java API (SAM-JDK) for creating new programs that read and write SAM files. Both SAM text format and SAM binary (BAM) format are supported.|N/A|[Vendor](http://picard.sourceforge.net/)|
|R|2.10.1 2.14.1 |R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.r-project.org/)|
|samtools|0.1.13 |SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format is a generic format for storing large nucleotide sequence alignments.|N/A|[Vendor](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)|
|sas|9.2 |SAS Statistical Analysis package|4|[Vendor](http://www.sas.com/)|
|tophat|2.0.7 |TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. It aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons.|The Artistic License|[Vendor](http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/)|
