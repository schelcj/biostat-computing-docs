|------|--------|-----------|------------------|-----|
|bedtools|2.11.2 |The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such as finding feature overlaps and computing coverage.|N/A|[Vendor](http://code.google.com/p/bedtools/)|
|biostat|1.0 |Biostatistics local repository|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.sph.umich.edu/biostat/)|
|bowtie|0.12.7 |Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient short read aligner. It aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to the human genome at a rate of over 25 million 35-bp reads per hour. Bowtie indexes the genome with a Burrows-Wheeler index to keep its memory footprint small|N/A|[Vendor](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml)|
|bwa|0.5.9 |Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is an efficient program that aligns relatively short nucleotide sequences against a long reference sequence such as the human genome.|N/A|[Vendor](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)|
|jags|3.1.0 |JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation  not wholly unlike BUGS.|N/A|[Vendor](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)|
|macs|1.3.7.1 |Next generation parallel sequencing technologies made chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) a popular strategy to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions, while creating challenges for analysis algorithms.|N/A|[Vendor](http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/)|
|mmap|20110912 |mixed models analysis for pedigrees and populations|N/A|[Vendor](http://edn.som.umaryland.edu/mmap/index.php)|
|omegamap|0.5 |omegaMap is a program for detecting natural selection and recombination in DNA or RNA sequences. It is based on a model of population genetics and molecular evolution. The signature of natural selection is detected using the dN/dS ratio (which measures the relative excess of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism) and the signature of recombination is detected from the patterns of linkage disequilibrium.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.danielwilson.me.uk/omegaMap.html)|
|R|2.10.1 2.14.1 |R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.r-project.org/)|
|samtools|0.1.13 |SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format is a generic format for storing large nucleotide sequence alignments.|N/A|[Vendor](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)|
|sas|9.2 |SAS Statistical Analysis package|4|[Vendor](http://www.sas.com/)|
