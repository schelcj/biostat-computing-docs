# Cluster Status #

### Tue Jul 17 22:42:38 EDT 2012 ###
The clsuter is returning to normal service. Several compute nodes
were reported and jobs running on those nodes where lost. Sorry, for
any inconvenience.

### Tue Jul 17 13:43:49 EDT 2012 ###
Currently we have nine compute nodes marked as down due to
and overload state. I am working to resolve the issue. Some jobs
may be lost during the recovery. Hopefully the cluster will be
back to a normal state tonight.

### Wed Jun 27 18:38:45 EDT 2012 ###
The cluster is back to normal operations at this time. 

### Wed Jun 27 13:02:26 EDT 2012 ###
Currently experiencing an outage due to a hardware failure on a DNS server.
This will cause logins to timeout and any new jobs submitted to fail. We
are working the problem now and hope to have this resolved shortly.

### Thu Jun 21 15:38:46 EDT 2012 ###
No outages have been reported at this time.
