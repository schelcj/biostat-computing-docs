### How do I have software installed? ###
Send an email to [sph-biostat-help@umich.edu][] with what you would like installed.

### Why is my job pending? ###
There can be several different reasons for your job to be in the pending state.
Some these reasons are but are not limited to:

* The cluster is at full utilization and no resources are available to meet your requirements
* You have requested more cores and or memory then are available to meet your requirements
* All available licenses have to checked out
* There is a reservation in place for maintenance and your job would potentially end during or after the reservation.
* You or an administrator has placed a job on hold 

### When will my job start? ###
To view the estimated start time of your pending job(s) use the *squeue* command.

    squeue -u $USER --start
