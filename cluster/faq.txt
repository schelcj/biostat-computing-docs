# How do I get an account? #
Have your faculty advisor or PI email [sph-biostat-help@umich.edu][] to request an account allocation.

# How do I have software installed? #
Send an email to [sph-biostat-help@umich.edu][] with what you would like installed.

# Why is my job pending? #
There can be several different reasons for your job to be in the pending state.
Some these reasons are but are not limited to:

* The cluster is at full utilization and no resources are available to meet your requirements
* You have requested more cores and or memory then are available to meet your requirements
* All available licenses have to checked out
* There is a reservation in place for maintenance and your job would potentially end during or after the reservation.
* You or an administrator has placed a job on hold 

# When will my job start? #
To view the estimated start time of your pending job(s) use the *squeue* command.

    squeue -u $USER --start

# How do you transfer files to and from the cluster? #
To transfer data, or code, to and from the cluster you must use [scp][] or [sftp][]. There are several
clients options depending on the platform of your client.

* scp/sftp are available by default on all linux distributions
* [WinSCP][] for Windows provides an Explorer like interface that support drag-n-drop
* [Putty][] for Windows is a suite of ssh related apps, most notably the terminal appilication.
  It also includes utilities for scp/sftp.
* [CyberDuck] for MacOSX
* [SecureShell] for Windows is availble for ITS as part of the BlueDisc

# How do you edit edit files/programs on the cluster? #
Access to the clsuter is limited to ssh connections within a terminal which means
you will need to be comfortable editing files outside of a GUI editor. There are several
text editors available on the cluster. These include but aren't limited to

* [nano][] probably the easiest for someone new to text editing in unix/linux. If
  you have used Pico, Nano will be very familiar.
* [Vim][] powerful editor that extends the Vi editor
