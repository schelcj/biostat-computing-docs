    #SBATCH --mail-user=uniqname@umich.edu
    #SBATCH --time=1-0

[sarray][] provides the iteration of the array to the batch script via the __$SLURM_ARRAYID__
environment variable. This provides a means of changing the flow of your code, executing a different
R script, or setting variables in your code. To access the variable from within R simply use the
*Sys.getenv()* function.

## R with snow(fall) ##

The snow and snowfall packages can be used in R to simplify the process of
writing parallel R scripts. These packages work by creating separate R processes
(slaves/nodes) and then sending jobs to those nodes in parellel. You have a
couple different options for communication between these nodes. The options are
communicationare [SOCKETS][], [MPI][], and [PVM][]. The biostatistics cluster does not implement
[PVM][] leaving you with a choice between [MPI][] and [SOCKETS][]. The basic difference between
the two is that [SOCKETS][] only allow communication within a single host and MPI
communicates across the network. When you submit a R job to the cluster using
snow/snowfall you should consider how many R cluster nodes you wish to start as
this will help you decide which type you need to use. You can think of the snow/snowfall
nodes as __1:1__ with cores and nodes, each node you start will use a single core.
If you need to start more slaves then a single cluster node has cores then you
will need to use MPI so those R slaves can communicate across the network.

Here are some examples of sbatch batch file for each type:

### Snow/Snowfall node type SOCK ###

This is a sample of initializing your cluster in snow and snowfall.

snow cluster init sample

    cl <- makeCluster(12, type="SOCK")

snowfall cluster init sample

    cl <- sfInit(parallel=T,cpus=12,type="SOCK")

This batch script requests a whole node be allocated to this job giving your
code up to 12 cores. This means you can start 12 snow/snowfall nodes within
your code.

    $ cat sock-job.txt
    #!/bin/sh
    #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
    #SBATCH --mail-user=uniqname@umich.edu
    #SBATCH --time=1-0
    #SBATCH --job-name=test_r_socket_job
    #SBATCH --node=1-1
    
    srun R CMD BATCH ./script.R

### Snow/Snowfall node type MPI ###

This is a sample of initializing your cluster in snow and snowfall.
snow cluster init sample

    makeCluster(100, type="MPI")

snowfall cluster init sample

    sfInit(parallel=T,cpus=100,type="MPI")

This batch script tells the scheduler that you would like to allocate 100
cpus(cores) to this single task, giving you 100 snow/snowfall nodes, that
it will run for one day and requires 2GB of memory.

    $ cat mpi-job.txt
    #!/bin/sh
    #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
    #SBATCH --mail-user=uniqname@umich.edu
    #SBATCH --ntasks=100
    #SBATCH --time=1-0
    #SBATCH --job-name=test_r_socket_job
    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2000
    
    R CMD BATCH ./script.R
