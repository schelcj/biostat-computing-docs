|boost|1.45.0 |Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.boost.org)|
|clapack|3.1.1 |The CLAPACK library was built using a Fortran to C conversion utility called f2c. The entire Fortran 77 LAPACK library is run through f2c to obtain C code, and then modified to improve readability. CLAPACK's goal is to provide LAPACK for someone who does not have access to a Fortran compiler.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.netlib.org/clapack/)|
|eigen|2.0.15 5.0.1 |Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra|N/A|[Vendor](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)|
|eigensoft|5.0.1 |EIGENSOFT version 5.0.1 is now available for download. The EIGENSOFT package combines functionality from our population genetics methods (Patterson et al. 2006) and our EIGENSTRAT stratification correction method (Price et al. 2006).|N/A|[Vendor](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)|
|gplot|1.3 |Gplot is a simple Perl script. It accepts a large set of options to generate a single plot of one or more sets of data (overlaid as necessary). The X and Y axis will be scaled automatically.|N/A|[Vendor](http://gplot.sourceforge.net/)|
|gsl|1.15 |The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public License. The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)|
|gurobi|4.5.1 4.5.2 4.6.0 |The Gurobi Optimizer is a state-of-the-art solver for linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP) and mixed-integer programming (MILP and MIQP). It was designed from the ground up to exploit modern multi-core processors.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.gurobi.com/)|
|hwloc|1.5 |The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs. It primarily aims at helping applications with gathering information about modern computing hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.|http|[Vendor](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/)|
|jags|2.2.0 3.1.0 |JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation  not wholly unlike BUGS.|N/A|[Vendor](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)|
|matlab|R2011b R2013a |Matlab is interactive package for numerical analysis, matrix computation, control system design, and linear system analysis and design|5|[Vendor](http://www.mathworks.com/)|
|mixmapper|1.02 |The MixMapper software performs admixture inference from allele frequency moment statistics.|N/A|[Vendor](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)|
|multimarkdown|3.2 |MultiMarkdown, or MMD, is a tool to help turn minimally marked-up plain text into well formatted documents, including HTML, PDF (by way of LaTeX), OPML, or OpenDocument (specifically, Flat OpenDocument or ‘.fodt’, which can in turn be converted into RTF, Microsoft Word, or virtually any other word-processing format). MMD is a superset of the Markdown syntax, originally created by John Gruber. It adds multiple syntax features (tables, footnotes, and citations, to name a few), in addition to the various output formats listed above (Markdown only creates HTML). Additionally, it builds in 'smart' typography for various languages (proper left- and right-sided quotes, for example).|N/A|[Vendor](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)|
|nctop|0.23.2 |nctop is a remote system monitor for unix hosts.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~hj28/)|

|padb|3.3 |Padb is a Job Inspection Tool for examining and debugging parallel programs, primarily it simplifies the process of gathering stack traces on compute clusters however it also supports a wide range of other functions. Padb supports a number of parallel environments and it works out-of-the-box on the majority of clusters. It's an open source, non-interactive, command line, script-able tool intended for use by programmers and system administrators alike.|N/A|[Vendor](http://padb.pittman.org.uk/)|
