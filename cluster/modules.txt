|gsl|1.15 |The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public License. The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)|
|gurobi|4.5.1 4.5.2 4.6.0 |The Gurobi Optimizer is a state-of-the-art solver for linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP) and mixed-integer programming (MILP and MIQP). It was designed from the ground up to exploit modern multi-core processors.|N/A|[Vendor](http://www.gurobi.com/)|
|jags|2.2.0 3.1.0 |JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation  not wholly unlike BUGS.|N/A|[Vendor](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)|

|multimarkdown|3.2 |MultiMarkdown, or MMD, is a tool to help turn minimally marked-up plain text into well formatted documents, including HTML, PDF (by way of LaTeX), OPML, or OpenDocument (specifically, Flat OpenDocument or ‘.fodt’, which can in turn be converted into RTF, Microsoft Word, or virtually any other word-processing format). MMD is a superset of the Markdown syntax, originally created by John Gruber. It adds multiple syntax features (tables, footnotes, and citations, to name a few), in addition to the various output formats listed above (Markdown only creates HTML). Additionally, it builds in 'smart' typography for various languages (proper left- and right-sided quotes, for example).|N/A|[Vendor](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)|
