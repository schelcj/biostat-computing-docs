# Login Nodes #

The login nodes are the front end to the cluster for all our users. They are accessible from
on and off campus. They are a shared resource and, as such, it is expected that users do not
monopolize them. 

## Policies covering usage ##

Appropriate uses of the login nodes:

* Transferring files to and from the clusters
* Creating, modifying, and compiling code and submission scripts
* Submitting and monitoring the status of jobs
* Testing executables to ensure they will run on the cluster's infrastructure
  *(limited to a maximum of 5 minutes of cpu-time)*. 

## Nodes ##

Primary login node pool __biostat-login.sph.umich.edu__ will log you into one of the login
nodes randomly. If you need to use the same node, for instance to use an existing screen session,
here is the list of current nodes that make up the login pool.

| Hostname                    | Architecture |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| biostat-login.sph.umich.edu | Intel        |
|                             |              |
| bajor.sph.umich.edu         | Intel        |
| idran.sph.umich.edu         | Intel        |

## Authentication ##

In order to login to the cluster you need a valid UMich [uniqname][] with [kerberos][] password. This is the same
account you use to access your email and or [wolverineaccess.umich.edu][].

## Transfering Data ##

To transfer data, or code, to and from the cluster you must use [scp][] or [sftp][]. There are several
clients options depending on the platform of your client.

* scp/sftp are available by default on all linux distributions
* [WinSCP][] for Windows provides an Explorer like interface that support drag-n-drop
* [Putty][] for windows is a suite of ssh related apps, most notably the terminal appilication.
  It also includes utilities for scp/sftp.
* [CyberDuck] for MacOSX
