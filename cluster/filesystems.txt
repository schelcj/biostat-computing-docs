| /home/*uniqname* | 50GB  | Home directories are available on all compute nodes across the cluster over NFS. There is a 50GB quota for all home direcotries. All home directories are backed up nightly.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| /tmp             | N/A   | Each compute node has local diskspace in /tmp available for your use. Writing to this directory saves you from writing over the network via NFS. This directory is not backed up and will be cleaned out on a regular basis.                                                                                                                              |
| [/afs][]         | 10GB  | The afs space available is the UMICH IFS cell. There is a symlink in your home directory /home/uniqname/ifs that is your IFS user home directory. IFS is only available on the login nodes not on the compute nodes. This means that you will need to copy any scripts/data from your ifs space to your home directory that are required to run your job. |
